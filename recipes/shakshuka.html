    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>This hearty shakshuka recipe brings the rich, comforting flavours of North Africa and the Middle East straight to your kitchen. Poached eggs simmer gently in a spiced tomato and capsicum sauce, seasoned with garlic, cumin and paprika for a bold, warming depth. Perfect for breakfast, brunch or even a light dinner, it’s best served with crusty bread to scoop up every last bit of the sauce. Simple, satisfying and packed with flavour, this one-pan dish is as nourishing as it is delicious.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, seeded and diced</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce can) whole peeled tomatoes</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 small bunch fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li>1 small bunch fresh parsley, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large sauté pan on medium heat. Add the chopped bell pepper and onion and cook for 5 minutes or until the onion becomes translucent.</li>
        <li>Add garlic and spices and cook an additional minute.</li>
        <li>Pour the can of tomatoes and juice into the pan and break down the tomatoes using a large spoon. Season with salt and pepper and bring the sauce to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Use your large spoon to make small wells in the sauce and crack the eggs into each well. Cook the eggs for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the eggs are done to your liking. You can also cover the pan with a lid to expedite the eggs cooking.</li>

    </ol>
