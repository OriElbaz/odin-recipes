    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This hearty shakshuka recipe brings the rich, comforting flavours of North Africa and the Middle East straight to your kitchen. Poached eggs simmer gently in a spiced tomato and capsicum sauce, seasoned with garlic, cumin and paprika for a bold, warming depth. Perfect for breakfast, brunch or even a light dinner, it’s best served with crusty bread to scoop up every last bit of the sauce. Simple, satisfying and packed with flavour, this one-pan dish is as nourishing as it is delicious.</p>
