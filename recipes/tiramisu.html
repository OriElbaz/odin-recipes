    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic tiramisu recipe is a decadent, no-bake dessert that layers rich espresso-soaked sponge fingers with a smooth, creamy mixture of mascarpone and whipped eggs. Lightly dusted with cocoa powder, each bite offers a perfect balance of coffee bitterness and sweet, velvety indulgence. It’s an elegant crowd-pleaser that’s surprisingly simple to make, ideal for dinner parties or special occasions. Best served chilled, this Italian favourite only gets better with time as the flavours meld together.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g Arnott’s Choc Ripple biscuits</li>
        <li>80g unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>3 egg yolks</li>
        <li>110g (1/2 cup) caster sugar</li>
        <li>250g tub mascarpone</li>
        <li>375ml (1 1/2 cups) thickened cream</li>
        <li>375ml (1 1/2 cups) freshly brewed espresso coffee, cooled</li>
        <li>2 tbsp water</li>
        <li>3 tsp gelatine powder</li>
        <li>12 savoiardi (sponge finger biscuits)</li>
        <li>Cocoa powder, to dust</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grease a 7cm-deep, 20cm (base size) square cake pan and line the base and sides with baking paper, allowing the paper to overhang the sides.</li>
        <li>Place the biscuits in a food processor and process until coarsely crushed. Add the butter and process until well combined. Use the back of a spoon to press the mixture evenly over the base of the prepared pan. Place in the fridge for 15 minutes to chill.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, use electric beaters to beat the egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl until pale and creamy. Add the mascarpone and cream. Beat until soft peaks form. Add 125ml (1/2 cup) coffee and beat until well combined. Pour the remaining 250ml (1 cup) coffee into a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place the water in a small microwave-safe bowl. Sprinkle with the gelatine and stir until well combined. Microwave for 10 seconds (do not overheat). Use a fork to whisk until the gelatine dissolves. With the beaters running, add the gelatine mixture to the mascarpone mixture. Beat until well combined. Spread 1/3 cup of the mascarpone mixture over the biscuit base. One at a time, quickly dip the sponge finger biscuits into the reserved coffee and arrange in a single layer in rows over the mascarpone layer, trimming to fit if necessary. Spoon over the remaining mascarpone mixture. Smooth the surface. Place in the fridge for 6 hours or overnight to set.</li>
        <li>Dust the slice with cocoa and slice to serve.</li>
    </ol>
