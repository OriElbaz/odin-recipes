    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This butter chicken recipe is a creamy, flavour-packed Indian favourite that’s both comforting and irresistible. Tender chicken pieces are marinated in yoghurt and spices, then simmered in a rich tomato and butter sauce with just the right amount of heat. Infused with garlic, ginger, and garam masala, the sauce is velvety smooth and perfect for scooping up with warm naan or spooning over fluffy rice. It’s a simple, satisfying dish that brings restaurant-quality flavour to your home kitchen.</p>
